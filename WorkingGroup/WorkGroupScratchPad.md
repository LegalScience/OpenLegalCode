## Charter

This is a voluntary unincirporated association of people and organizations coming together for the common purpose of assisting [launch-time: New York City Council Member Ben Kallos][Template: the Steering Group] to successfully deploy selected bodies of law from paper or proprietary formats and modes eventually to 

* structred data in one or more common formats
* subject to creative commons or similar license 
* accessible at REST interfaces 
* citable to by one or more common methods 
* annotatable by one or more common methods 
* amendable by creation, modification or deletion by authoritative body
* Verifiable source provenance and version control 

## Business, Legal and Technology Groups

There are three key groups focused on each of the three core functional domains: 
Business:
Legal:
Technology:


## Description of the WG on a larger "RoadMap" showing it's place

* The level of abstraction and bounaries of the roadmap are:  
 - eg: The roadmap shows the systems of law making, hosting, human/macine access and feedback for New York City legal code

* The components within the roadmap are: 
Name the key Business Legal and Technical Systems of Systems, ie:

- business/political/operational systems (City Council, Mayor, Courts, Publisher, etc)

- legal systems (parliamentary procedure, IP or EULA if any to the law, Interpretation ie arbitration/courts, regulations, etc, bodies of law affected/affecting the code, groups of practitioners of law by action type or subject domain, academic treatments of the law, etc 

- technical system (the software and workflow and data model/format at law making, publishing, distribution, use, downstream, etc.  also the systems that ingest the laws and process or compute the laws in various ways.  also the emerging market of apps and services, etc, etc)

* The key inputs/outputs/relations between components within the roadmap are:
- tbd

* The key inputs/outputs/relations between items on the roadmap and outside the roadmap are:
- tbd

* The mechanism and method for iterating this roadmap is:
- tbd (maybe it is just an informal creative commons artifact of the Kallos Committee for Goodness?) 

## Proposed WG members 

* Ben Kallos
* Thom
* Dazza
* Jose (Boston City Attorney)
* Many many others... 

## Expected deliverables or other outcomes  

* Design Concept and Prototype Development Plan 

* Design for OpenLegalCode 

* Key Design Component: Structure/format for expressing the law as data

* Prototype of OpenLegalCode

* MVP OpenLegalCode System for Legislation and laws (Hosting (Rackspace?), Platform/Interfaces/Services, External Apps)?

* Plan for Tests/Pilots Iterative Processes

## Anticipated Key Meetings Schedule and Agenda or Meeting Purpose

* Kick-Off Meeting, initialization, agree to charter, work plan, etc.  set agenda and schedule.

* Regular working meetings (subgroups, liasion groups, collaboration partners etc)

* Perhaps Three big meetings (with pre-meeting to prepare, interim meeting to work, and post-project meetings to transition): 
 - MEETING ONE: June - Project Launch (MIT Hackathon?)
 - MEETING TWO: July - Mid-Project Presentation and Review/Feedback
 - MEETING THREE: August - Final Presentation and Review/Hand-Off for Transition to "Business Owners" in city gov't, non-prof, etc.    For post-handoff transition to the more stable phase of pilot/implementation, it will be important to start discussing models that can have an easy transition from the design phase and are the right size and complexity for the anticipated group and projects and dynamics of voluntary collaboration... here is a starter file identifying some initial - incomplete - models: (https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/WorkingGroup/Resources/RelevantModels.md)
