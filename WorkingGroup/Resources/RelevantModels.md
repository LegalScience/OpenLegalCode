Today, April 9, I got a note from IFTI that they have fixed a [major security hole](http://heartbleed.com/) on the Internet compromising SSL.  When I poked around a little, I saw [the fix](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt) came from (and fixed the product of) a group called the "OpenSSL Project" descriing itself thusly:

"The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.

OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an Apache-style licence, which basically means that you are free to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple license conditions."


The simple organization of the project is comprised of a "core team" and a "dev team" and they work everything out on email lists, as far as I can tell.  This is not especially different from a "steering cmt" and a "project team" approach followed by our ReEntryApp project and modeled for this OpenLegalCode project. It may be worth speaking with people on the core team of OpenSSL to learn more about their approach and whether aspects of it could be a good fit for the post design phase more stable state of this project.

Email from IFTI follow:

Hello dazza, 

A major vulnerability in the technology that powers encryption across much of the internet was discovered this week. Like many other teams, we took immediate action to patch the vulnerability in our infrastructure. 

IFTTT is no longer vulnerable. 

Though we have no evidence of malicious behavior, we've taken the extra precaution of logging you out of IFTTT on the web and mobile. We encourage you to change your password not only on IFTTT, but everywhere, as many of the services you love were affected. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please email security@ifttt.com. 

â€”The IFTTT Team

# IDFederation.org

* Likely too heavyweight for any time soon.  Involves setting up a 501(c)(6) non-profit.

# NSTIC IDESG - idecosystem.org

* Also likely too heavyweight at this time, but a nice inclusive model in theory.

# Voluntary "OpenGov Consortium" Blog-Based Approach

* I modeled and prototyped this for City of Boston... it has some merit and fit potentially for next phase of this project.  I will dig it out and link to it.
