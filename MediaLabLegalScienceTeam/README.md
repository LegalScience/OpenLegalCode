This directory of the OpenLegalCode Repo is for resources by or related to the MIT Media Lab Human Dynamics researcher team pursuing LegalScience, led by Dazza Greenwood of the Media Lab.  

Below is an overview of the current concept of collaboration and basic parameters of time, scope, contribution, relationship, and planned end-of-project transition:

We discussed structuring a collaboration between Ben Kallos and the LegalScience team of the Media Lab along the lines of how we are collaborating with the Federal District Judge Aiken on the ReEntryApp, namely: a three month "design and rapid prototype" volunteer and informal, open, public and participatory project with some light-weight incubation and facilitation by the Media Lab (ie this GitHub repo, designing a track at our Legal Hackathon, helping to call in partners willing to join an informal meetings or sprints, etc) and that culminates with a "hand-off" of the resulting design and whatever level of prototype we have adopted and/or adapted and/or created to a more stable multi-stakeholder group that has participated in the design phase and is ready to take over the role played by the Media Lab LegalScience team after the summer.  For more on this general model, please see: [ReEntryApp.Net](http://reentryapp.net] and our GitHub project files at: (https://github.com/ReEntry/DesignPhase)
