**Note** There is a nice script editor for javascripts.  This can be used to automate a process that goes to get, for example, all uses of a given word in a statute or other code by year, or by jurisdiction or perhaps by chapter of law and then load it into a google spreadsheet pre-configured with an appropriate chart to enable highly responsive visualizations.
