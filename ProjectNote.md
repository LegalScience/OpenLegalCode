**Ben Kallos and Dazza Greenwood Collaboration on putting New York City Code online**


## Next steps

* An intro has been made to the City of Bosotn CIO, and I prepped him and his team by email.  At least one key staffer was excited to meet Ben.  Next step is to close the loop and assess interest to schedule a call. 

* An intro has been made to Seamus and was preceeded by a prep call with him.  He is excited to meet Ben.  Seamus has replied.  Next steps is to schedule a call. 

* Testimony for June 6 is great.  Next steps is to send an invitation letter to Sandy Pentland of hd.media.mit.edu and either I will testify or somebody even better. 

* MIT Legal Hackathon is tentatively scheduled for June 19-22, with business oriented meeting 19/20 Thur/Fri) and hacker/coder/maker activity 21/22 (Sat/Sun).  Dates are confirmed (tentatively?) with Anthony.  Next step is to discuss a notional agenda for the NYC/City Law track and set a day/time on 19 or 20 for a speech at MIT proper, with a title and very short abstract for time being (a couple sentences is fine).  Next step: brief call or hangout to discuss.  

* Idea to form a working group (from Aprol 6 meeting) resulted in creating a directory on this Repo, at: (https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/tree/master/WorkingGroup).  I suggest we each hack away at a charter, proposed WG members and perhaps a notional description of expected deliverables or other outcomes on this "[WorkingGroupScratchPad.md](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/WorkingGroup/WorkGroupScratchPad.md)" file.  

## Items from Initial Call on April 6, 2014

* Introduction for Ben Kallos to Shamus/Issa Open Government Foundation

DONE

* Testimony from MIT Media Lab on June 6, 2014 (Minimally from Dazza, maybe someone better)

CONFIRMED.  Invitation letter to Professor Sandy Pentland at Media Lab (hd.media.mit.edu) citing out conversationa nd collaboration would be helpful.  Minimally, I can do this and perhaps we can improve that with Sandy or another faculty-level guru. 


* Introduction to Boston in order to move forward as two city solution for CiviCommons on Legislation/Laws

DONE.

* Create working group to create "best" model for NYC

  - MVP for Legislation/Legal hosting

I propose this topic be an agenda item for our next conversation.  

Meanwhile, I have [provisioned place in this repo](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/tree/master/WorkingGroup) where we can hack away and a [scratch pad with outline to iterate from.](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/WorkingGroup/WorkGroupScratchPad.md) 

* Commitment from MIT Media Lab/Sub Light Foundation 

DONE

* Here is a link to the Uniform Laws analytics we are starting to work on... this is still under wraps and confidential and partly wrong but please take a look and try to hack it if  you want:

* There is a nice script editor for javascripts.  This can be used to automate a process that goes to get, for example, all uses of a given word in a statute or other code by year, or by jurisdiction or perhaps by chapter of law and then load it into a google spreadsheet pre-configured with an appropriate chart to enable highly responsive visualizations.
