**Ben Kallos and Dazza Greenwood Collaboration on putting New York City Code online**


## Next steps as of April 9th

* From April 6: Dazza confirmed with Sandy Pentland a green light to provision a lightweight informal collaboration between Dazza Greenwood in his MIT Media Lab capacity and Ben Kallos in his NY City Council capacity to help put the law online in the best way possible for NYC and **by design** intended to enable/promote scalable, agreeable methods other jurisdictions (hopefully starting with City of Boston) can partner on now or adopt/adapt later.  See followup [note below](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/ProjectNote.md#items-from-initial-call-on-april-6-2014) and more info on the [README](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/MediaLabLegalScienceTeam/README.md) file.

* From April 6 Call: An intro has been made to the City of Bosotn CIO, and I prepped him and his team by email.  At least one key staffer was excited to meet Ben.  Next step is to close the loop and assess interest to schedule a call. 

* From April 6 Call: An intro has been made to Seamus and was preceeded by a prep call with him.  He is excited to meet Ben.  Seamus has replied.  Next steps is to schedule a call. 

* From April 6 Call: Testimony for June 6 in NYC is great.  Next steps is to send an invitation letter to Sandy Pentland of hd.media.mit.edu and either I will testify or somebody even better. 

* From April 6 Call: MIT Legal Hackathon is tentatively scheduled for June 19-22, with business oriented meeting 19/20 Thur/Fri) and hacker/coder/maker activity 21/22 (Sat/Sun).  Dates are confirmed (tentatively?) with Anthony.  Next step is to discuss a notional agenda for the NYC/City Law track and set a day/time on 19 or 20 for a speech at MIT proper, with a title and very short abstract for time being (a couple sentences is fine).  Next step: brief call or hangout to discuss.  

* From April 6 Call: Idea to form a working group (from Aprol 6 meeting) resulted in creating a directory on this Repo, at: (https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/tree/master/WorkingGroup).  I suggest we each hack away at a charter, proposed WG members and perhaps a notional description of expected deliverables or other outcomes on this "[WorkingGroupScratchPad.md](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/WorkingGroup/WorkGroupScratchPad.md)" file.  

*  From April 6 Call: Hangout Meeting is Scheduled for Thursday, April 17

* NEW: We should have a general timeline to capture/log important things on a simple chronological axis.  Therefor, I have provisioned this draft project "live timeline" file at (https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/Timeline.md)  I suggest we use this to communicate the then current dates and key info (links, purpose, location, etc) for important events that involve other partners or that others partners may need/wish to know about.  In this way, it is hoped we can spend less time coordinating by targeting the key communication to a common resource that each partner can update in a simple open format.  
- Recommend keeping a log file in update form with key "to-do" items from meetings, etc evolving into "DONE" items as reflected on this page and then pull the truly key upcoming events and activities onto a timeline page as we go so people looking to see what has happened can consult this page and people who just need quick logistics for planning can consult the timeline page. An event on the timeline will likely involve various aspects of content on a log/update page, so I think it is simplest to just have two file - but hopefully not more than two - for purposes of enabling and managing this informal collaboration.  



 
## Items from Initial Call on April 6, 2014
(Note - in future this will be rolled into the update but I wrote the below info earlier than the above info and don't want to spend the time editing it all together... please glance at both the above and below and from April 9th forward it will be merged to a running "updates" log in the format used above...and of course, that format may well further evolve.) 

* Confirm new idea to create a collaboration between Dazza Greenwood (solely or primarily in his MIT Media Lab capacity) and Ben Kallos (solely or primarily in his City Council capacity).  

DONE

Note on this item:  For more info, see [README](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/MediaLabLegalScienceTeam/README.md) file.  Dazza confirmed with Sandy Pentland a green light to spend some time, informally and on a voluntary basis, pursuing the collaboration with Ben Kallos and (it is hoped) more stakeholders and jurisdictions as we go) on this project to advance putting the law online in the way Ben has proposed.  As discussed, we plan to use the [same model of collaboration](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/MediaLabLegalScienceTeam/README.md) as we are using with Federal Judge Aiken on the ReEntryApp project (a three month design and rapid prototype phase culminating with something pretty good and people working together suitable to be "handed-off" to an agreed more stable host environment).  Current concept of this collaboration is in the [README file](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/MediaLabLegalScienceTeam/README.md) of a [directory](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/MediaLabLegalScienceTeam) for the Media Lab I set up in this [repo](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/). 

* Introduction for Ben Kallos to Shamus/Issa Open Government Foundation

DONE

* Testimony from MIT Media Lab on June 6, 2014 (Minimally from Dazza, maybe someone better)

CONFIRMED.  Invitation letter to Professor Sandy Pentland at Media Lab (hd.media.mit.edu) citing out conversationa nd collaboration would be helpful.  Minimally, I can do this and perhaps we can improve that with Sandy or another faculty-level guru. 


* Introduction to Boston in order to move forward as two city solution for CiviCommons on Legislation/Laws

DONE.

* Create working group to create "best" model for NYC

  - MVP for Legislation/Legal hosting

I propose this topic be an agenda item for our next conversation.  

Meanwhile, I have [provisioned place in this repo](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/tree/master/WorkingGroup) where we can hack away and a [scratch pad with outline to iterate from.](https://github.com/LegalScience/OpenLegalCode/blob/master/WorkingGroup/WorkGroupScratchPad.md) 

* Commitment from MIT Media Lab/Sub Light Foundation 

DONE vis-a-vis Media Lab and Conversation w/Sunlight happening later today, April 9th (however, please note preliminary informal chatter at the highest levels of their foundation signal much synergy and high potential for collaboration).

* Here is a link to the Uniform Laws analytics we are starting to work on... this is still under wraps and confidential and partly wrong but please take a look and try to hack it if  you want:

* There is a nice script editor for javascripts.  This can be used to automate a process that goes to get, for example, all uses of a given word in a statute or other code by year, or by jurisdiction or perhaps by chapter of law and then load it into a google spreadsheet pre-configured with an appropriate chart to enable highly responsive visualizations.
